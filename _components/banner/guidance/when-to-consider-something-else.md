- **If you don't use a .gov/.mil domain and HTTPS.** The banner text identifies .gov/.mil domains and HTTPS as indicators that a website is an official government website. Use the banner only if your site uses both the proper TLD _and_ HTTPS.
- **Any time it would be misleading.** The banner should be used to reduce confusion. Avoid using the banner on any site meant only for testing or otherwise not meant to be identified as an official government website.
