Like the extended header, the extended header with megamenu allows for inclusion of more sections in your horizontal navigation; it also allows you to include more links in any of your dropdowns. You can customize the header (depending on your site structure) and use it:
- With a text or image logo
- With or without the expandable search bar
- With or without call-to-action buttons in place of the secondary links in the horizontal navigation
