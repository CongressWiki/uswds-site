- **Code header areas in the accordion as buttons.** Using a `<button>` assures that accordions are usable with both screen readers and the keyboard.
- **Use `aria-expanded` on buttons to express an accordion’s default state.** Buttons should state if they are expanded by default with `aria-expanded="true"`. The `aria-expanded="false"` attributes will be added to other buttons when the accordion is initialized by the JavaScript.
- **Use unique ids.** Each button has a unique name `aria-controls="id"` that associates the control to the appropriate region by referencing the controlled element’s `id`.
- **The accordion uses javascript to set the `hidden` value of its content area.** Each content area will have its `hidden` attribute set by the component, depending on its corresponding button’s `aria-expanded` attribute. To ensure that your content is accessible in the event that the JavaScript does not load or is disabled, you should not manually set `hidden` on any of your content areas.
